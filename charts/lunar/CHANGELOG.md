# Changelog

All notable changes to the `lunar` Helm chart are recorded here.

The format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
chart versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

History starts at 1.0.0 (the snippet→script rename and ghcr.io
switchover); earlier 0.x versions had no production users. For 0.x
history see `git log -- charts/lunar/`.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **Hub `/var/lib/lunar` is now an ephemeral `emptyDir`, not a PVC.** The hub
  holds no durable state on disk — `/var/lib/lunar` is only re-extracted
  runtimes and a rebuildable snippet-code cache (code is served from S3) — so
  the RWO `hub-data` PersistentVolumeClaim has been removed in favour of an
  `emptyDir` with a configurable `hub.stateDir.sizeLimit` (default `2Gi`). This
  removes the last per-instance source of truth on the hub filesystem and lets
  the hub `RollingUpdate` at `hub.replicaCount > 1` with no shared-volume
  contention (supersedes the 2.6.0 render-time guard that forced persistence
  off for HA — there is no longer a persistence toggle to conflict).

### Removed

- **`hub.persistence`** (`.enabled`, `.storageClass`, `.size`, `.accessModes`)
  and the `hub-data` PVC template — replaced by the ephemeral `emptyDir` above.
- **`hub.rootDir`** and the `HUB_ROOT_DIR` env var — dead/legacy; the hub has no
  such config field.

> **Upgrade note.** The existing `<release>-hub-data` PVC carried
> `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so upgrading will **not** delete it — it is
> simply orphaned and can be removed manually to reclaim storage. **Sequencing:**
> deploy the B1 S3-serve stack and trigger one manifest re-pull (so the current
> manifest has S3 `bundle_key`s) *before* moving replicas onto cold-disk
> `emptyDir` pods.

> Note: sequences after 2.6.0 (the multi-replica baseline, #65). If 2.6.0 has
> not landed when this merges, reconcile the version.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Multi-replica baseline for the hub.** New `hub.replicaCount` (default `1`,
  unchanged behavior), `hub.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default `60`),
  `hub.topologySpreadConstraints` (default none), and an optional
  `hub.podDisruptionBudget` (default **off** — a PDB on a single replica can
  block voluntary node drains; enable for HA). These let the hub run at
  `replicaCount > 1` healthily (spread across nodes/zones, drain-safe). HA also
  requires `hub.persistence.enabled=false` (hub state lives in Postgres) — the
  chart now **fails fast at render time** on `replicaCount > 1` with persistence
  still enabled, instead of leaving replicas stuck contending for one RWO PVC.

> Note: sequences after 2.5.0 (the migrate pre-rollout Job, #64). If 2.5.0 has
> not landed when this merges, reconcile the version.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- Bump the hub, snippet operator/init/sidecar, grafana, and agent images
  to `2.4.1`. Highlights carried by the new images:
  - **Buildkite**: PR builds are scoped to the components actually
    changed, and webhook authentication is now durable via
    `HUB_BUILDKITE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`.
  - **Operator**: runner-pod OOM kills are reported together with the
    snippet identity that triggered them, for faster diagnosis.
  - **Performance**: dashboard UI materialization is coalesced through a
    dirty table and refreshed more efficiently, cutting load and update
    lag on busy hubs.
  - **Security**: high-severity Go dependency updates
    (`golang.org/x/crypto`, `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/sys`,
    `jackc/pgx`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- `hub.github.apps[].host` and `hub.github.apps[].baseUrl` (both
  optional) let one multi-App Hub serve GitHub Enterprise Server orgs
  alongside github.com / GitHub Enterprise Cloud. When set, they render
  into the matching `HUB_GITHUB_APPS` entry as `host` / `base_url`, so
  the Hub keys that org's components by `(host, owner, name)` and calls
  its GHES API endpoint. Both default to github.com behaviour and are
  omitted from the rendered JSON when empty, so existing github.com-only
  multi-App configs render byte-for-byte unchanged. The Hub-side support
  shipped earlier in `earthly/lunar` (ENG-720); this exposes it through
  the chart (ENG-720 Phase 11).

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Grafana: moved the static, image-coupled `GF_*` settings out of the
  Grafana Deployment `env` and into the `lunar-grafana` image
  (`GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS`, `GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS`,
  `GF_DASHBOARDS_DEFAULT_HOME_DASHBOARD_PATH`, `GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP`,
  `GF_USERS_DEFAULT_THEME`, `GF_FEATURE_TOGGLES_ENABLE`). They now version
  with the image and no longer shadow it; override per-deployment via
  `grafana.extraEnv`. Requires a `lunar-grafana` image with these baked in
  (built from the matching `grafana/Earthfile`).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `operator.scriptPodPriorityClassName` (default `""`) sets the
  `priorityClassName` on every script pod the operator creates
  (earthly/lunar#1784), rendered as `OPERATOR_SNIPPET_POD_PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME`.
  Empty leaves the field unset, so pods take the cluster's default
  priority. The referenced PriorityClass must already exist in the
  cluster. Foundational for forcing snippets to be terminated before
  service pods in single-namespace setups, or prioritizing workloads
  in shared scratch namespaces.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Grafana: three bugs in the cronos Runs dashboard
  (earthly/lunar#1710). The `[collectors]`/`[policies]` links
  from the component dashboard now land on populated rows;
  policy script names in the Queued tab render as clickable
  links; the `Created` column displays relative time. Ships
  in `lunar-grafana:2.2.1`.

### Changed

- Hub: new partial B-tree index on `snippet_runs (started_at
  DESC) WHERE started_at IS NOT NULL` (earthly/lunar#1708)
  speeds up narrow-window Runs queries (~300× on a
  `started_at`-only filter, ~6.5× on a 1-day panel render).
  Applied by the hub's migration runner on startup; fresh
  environments build the index inline with a brief
  `ShareLock` on `snippet_runs`.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Multi-App GitHub auth. New `hub.github.apps` list pairs each
  `{owner, appId, installId}` with a per-owner PEM in an
  operator-managed Secret referenced by `hub.github.appsSecret`.
  In multi-App mode the chart renders `HUB_GITHUB_APPS` JSON and
  mounts the Secret at `/secrets/github-apps`. The legacy
  `hub.github.app.*` single-App configuration is unchanged and
  remains supported; render-time validation enforces mutual
  exclusivity between the two modes.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- `hub.secrets.<scope>.perKey` (default `false`) flips the script-secrets
  delivery shape for each scope from a single `HUB_<SCOPE>_SECRETS=KEY1:VAL1,...`
  env var (`secretKeyRef`) to a per-key `envFrom: secretRef + prefix:` mount,
  surfacing each data key as `HUB_<SCOPE>_SECRET_<KEY>=<value>`. Operators
  can now rotate or add a single key with `kubectl patch secret` without
  re-supplying all the others. Requires hub >= 2.2.0; the hub merges both
  shapes when both are configured (per-key wins on conflict) so callers
  can migrate one key at a time. See README "Script secrets (optional)"
  for the full migration walkthrough.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-20

### Breaking

- **Dual-ingress topology.** Webhooks can now be exposed on a separate
  ingress from the API. `hub.ingress` reshaped into `hub.ingress.api`
  and `hub.ingress.webhooks`. The previous single-host ingress
  configuration is no longer accepted.
- `publicBaseURL` removed in favor of the new ingress shape plus
  `hub.webhookURL` for BYO fallback. The chart computes per-component
  URLs from the right ingress.

### Changed

- `HUB_GRAFANA_URL_BASE` and Grafana's own `GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL` resolve
  from a trust-boundary-correct chain (api ingress → grafana ingress →
  explicit `hub.grafanaURLBase` → `hub.webhookURL` fallback), instead
  of always pointing at the public webhook ingress. Fixes OIDC
  redirect-URI breakage on split-host installs.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Worker concurrency values under `hub.maxWorkers.{collect,policy,cronCollect,cataloger}`
  surface the Hub's `HUB_MAX_WORKERS_*` env vars through the chart.
- Operator pool size and Hub operator-queue pool size are configurable;
  defaults are unlimited.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Image tag pin uses the release version `2.1.1` rather than the
  `v`-prefixed `v2.1.1`, which did not exist in the registry.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-17

### Breaking

- "Snippet" → "Script" rename throughout values and templates.
  `operator.snippet*` keys are gone; use the new `script*` equivalents.
- Default image pulls switched from Docker Hub (`earthly/lunar-*`) to
  GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/earthly/lunar-*`). Set
  `image.registry` back to `docker.io` for tenants still pinning
  Docker-Hub-only dev-build SHAs.
- All images pinned to the release version `2.1.1` instead of floating
  `main`.

### Changed

- README rewritten: values reference, image rows, and inline mentions
  updated for the rename. "snippet" survives only in the image names
  themselves.
